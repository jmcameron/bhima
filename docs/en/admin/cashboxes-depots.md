# Cashboxes and Depots 

In BHIMA, cashboxes and depots contain physical assets and therefore have special permissions for users to access their contents.  These permissions are set on the `Administration > Users` module.

Within the **User Management** module, the cashbox and depot settings are available in the `Action` menu of the grid.  Users may be authorized to access one or more of each kind of resource using a checkbox tree in a modal.  Once the user's permissions have been set, they must log out of the application and re-login for the changes to take effect.
